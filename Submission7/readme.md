Your new target is:
99.4% (this must be consistently shown in your last few epochs, and not a one-time achievement)
Less than or equal to 15 Epochs
Less than 8000 Parameters
Do this using your modular code. Every model that you make must be there in the model.py file as Model_1, Model_2, etc.
Do this in exactly 3 steps
Each File must have a "target, result, analysis" TEXT block (either at the start or the end)
You must convince why have you decided that your target should be what you have decided it to be, and your analysis MUST be correct.
Evaluation is highly subjective, and if you target anything out of the order, marks will be deducted.
Explain your 3 steps using these targets, results, and analysis with links to your GitHub files (Colab files moved to GitHub).
Keep Receptive field calculations handy for each of your models.

Aim
Achieve 99.4% Test Accuracy in 15 epochs or less with an 8000 parameter or less model.

Approach
We do three iterations starting from a baseline from the previous assignment taking steps towards the aim. The models are specified in the model.py file numbered from model1 to model3.

There are three other files model1.ipynb to model3.ipynb which are responsible for running and testing the models. They also contain the Target, Results and Analysis after each run.

The utils.py file contains the additional methods required for the model training.
